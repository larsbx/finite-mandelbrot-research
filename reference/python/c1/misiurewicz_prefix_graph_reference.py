"""Python reference for src/C1_misiurewicz_prefix_graph.mojo.

Integer arithmetic only, everything inside `Z/den`.

The obstruction extractor of `docs/p1-overlap-minimal-obstruction-2026-09-14.md`
in `larsbx/pisot-substitution-conjecture-research`, run on the finite graphs the
exact-type catalogue supplies. The pipeline is the one route F1 describes
abstractly in `docs/C1_F1_obstruction_extraction.md`:

    vertices   forward orbit closure of a catalogue under doubling
    pairs      the unordered non-diagonal pairs of vertices
    nonprod    the pairs no iterate of doubling ever separates
    sinks      the sink components of the nonproductive set, of two kinds
    dichotomy  each *cyclic* sink is a boundary or an interior obstruction

A separator is a pair of distinct rays *with a landing tag*. Admissibility
(`docs/C1_admissible_separator_codes.md`) requires both rays to be landed by
accepted theorem tags and the pair declared co-landing, and it forbids a generic
landing tag. Nothing here invents that evidence: a separator arrives tagged or
it is refused. There is deliberately no function that builds a prefix out of
addresses alone, because no such function could supply the co-landing evidence.

A point equal to either ray of a separator is `ON_SEPARATOR`, never a side.
`docs/C1_wake_membership_soundness.md` and `docs/C1_side_assignment_witnesses.md`
both forbid using that case as separation evidence, so it can never discharge a
pair.

Doubling is a function, so the pair graph has out-degree at most one and each
component either falls into one cycle or ends at a merging pair; no
strongly-connected-component search is needed. A merging pair has no outgoing
edge, so it is a terminal sink rather than a transient vertex, and it is counted
by `merging` instead of being forced into the boundary/interior dichotomy, which
asks whether a cycle meets a separator boundary.

`main` replays the pinned declared prefixes and the refusal battery.
