# Finite-Regime Mandelbrot Research

**Canonical repository:** `larsbx/finite-mandelbrot-research` is the sole active development home for the finite-regime Mandelbrot research program. The former `larsbx/NLAP-JT` repository is historical; migration provenance and cutover details are recorded in `MIGRATION.md`.

This repository develops a finite, certificate-carrying formulation of Mandelbrot-set computation.

The project goal is not to replace the classical analytic Mandelbrot set with a false finite exact object. Instead, it formalizes a hierarchy of finite algebraic certificates that reproduce the observable content available at finite resolution while isolating the single generic-boundary obstruction as MLC / fiber triviality.

## Priority-zero conjecture

The source of truth for what would prove C1 is:

```text
docs/C1_proof_definition_and_priority.md
```

C1 proof work is `PRIORITY_ZERO`. A completion claim must establish every required proof block in that document and supply a finite proof object checked by the Mojo theorem kernel. The current highest-priority open block is:

```text
ResidualClosureNoMissingLinks
```

A final C1 proof may not leave a `MissingTheoremCatalogueLink` exit open.

## Core thesis

A Mandelbrot generator can be specified without primitive reliance on real numbers, analytic complex-number objects, limits, transcendental functions, trigonometric functions, circles as rank-2 primitives, or infinite series by using:

- integer polynomial critical-orbit recurrences;
- dyadic rational boxes as finite interval objects;
- squarefree polynomial localization;
- pointwise exact-type exclusions;
- symbolic rational ray-address combinatorics;
- rank-2 coordinate records for executable algebra;
- finite incidence objects instead of analytic point primitives;
- named external theorem dependencies for analytic landing/fiber results.

## Mojo-first implementation and theorem-kernel policy

Mojo is the default first-class language for executable finite computations, certificate encodings, and finite proof-object checking in this repository. Python remains acceptable for CI linting, reference oracles, and migration scaffolds, but Mojo owns the primary certificate kernels once a Mojo implementation exists.

Mojo code should prioritize:

- value-like structs with explicit fields;
- normalized integer/rational representations;
- allocation-light polynomial and interval kernels;
- Horner evaluation for polynomial computations;
- batchable catalogue and interval scans;
- explicit backend boundaries for arbitrary-precision integers;
- separation of debug/demo paths from proof-grade paths.

Mojo is the trusted finite theorem kernel for repository proof objects. Classical analytic conclusions require explicit theorem-tag imports and adapter lemmas; Mojo does not silently reprove imported analytic theorems.

## Current mathematical focus

The current research focus is C1, now phrased as separator catalogue adequacy plus the residual fiber-triviality frontier:

```text
SeparatorCatalogueSoundness:
  Separated_k(A,B) -> ClassicallySeparated(A,B)

SeparatorCatalogueCompleteness:
  ClassicallySeparated(A,B) -> exists k. Separated_k(A,B)

SeparatorCatalogueAdequacy:
  soundness + completeness
```

After adequacy, persistent finite non-separation presents the classical same-fiber relation on the covered domain. Therefore any theorem that eliminates all distinct persistent non-separation has fiber-triviality / MLC strength under global coverage. The repository marks this as `OPEN_FRONTIER`, not as solved.

## Rank-2 layer rule

At the rank-2 certificate layer, the available objects are coordinate records, coefficient operations, polynomial operations, polynomial predicates, and quadrance scalars.

The following are not primitive constructors, APIs, or inference rules at rank 2:

- circle;
- disk;
- arc;
- circumference;
- polar angle;
- connected component;
- interior;
- boundary;
- analytic locus.

Such concepts require an explicit higher-layer adapter and cannot be imported merely from the polynomial expression `Q(x,y)=x^2+y^2`.

## Exact arithmetic policy

Every certificate-relevant number is a normalized rational or a rational-endpoint interval, never a float. The contract, its conformance criteria, and the binding of each kernel module to it are in:

```text
docs/rational-interval-arithmetic-spec.md
```

That file is mirrored verbatim in the PSC research repository and is enforced here by `tools/audit_exact_arithmetic.py`, the `tools/exact_arithmetic_allowlist.md` quarantine list, the `backend.toml` policy keys, and the law tests in `src/smoke_tests.mojo` and `tests/test_exact_arithmetic_spec.py`.

## Fail closed, and which way closed points

"Fail closed" appears throughout this repository as though it had one meaning.
It has two, and they point opposite ways. `larsbx/native-deployment-control-plane`
is the repository in this estate that says so, and this section adopts its
distinction rather than reaching it independently:

> For deploy gates, failing closed means refusing to proceed. For a destructive
> operation, failing closed means refusing to delete. Uncertainty is never
> resolved in favour of deletion.

Sorted by effect, not by name:

| Operation | Closed means | Because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A prefix-graph or catalogue cap is reached | refuse to conclude | an exhausted budget is not a verdict; a capped run reports as capped (`UW-2`) |
| A separator is not admissible | refuse to measure | an unproved cut reported as a decided measure is worse than no measure |
| A rejected exact value enters an arithmetic chain | refuse and stay rejected | rejection is sticky, so a doubtful number cannot be laundered by later operations |
| A generated surface disagrees with its table | refuse the run (`make_ledger.py --check`) | the surface is a function of the table, so disagreement is drift, not a new fact |
| A proof block is to be demoted or a tag withdrawn | **refuse to demote** | the block stays in the ledger with its status visible; an uncertain withdrawal removes the record the doubt was about |
| A pinned certificate or reference transcript is to be regenerated | **refuse to overwrite** | the pinned bytes are what a reader replays; a doubtful regeneration destroys the evidence rather than the doubt |

The first four refuse to *proceed*. The last two refuse to *destroy*, and a
rule that only knew the word would have had them delete. When a new gate is
added, say which column it is in; when it is not obvious, it is the second,
because that is the direction that cannot be undone.

What fails closed is the *uncertain* case. A demotion or a regeneration whose
evidence is clear is a deliberate, attributable act, and this rule does not
stand in its way.

`claim_governance.toml` restates the terminology, no-trigonometry, no-points,
rank-2 locus, and paper-language rules as configuration for the vendored
`tools/claim_governance` package. Its `[[claim]]` block is no longer written by
hand: the proof-record table of `tools/make_ledger.py` is the single source of
the C1 proof-block statuses, and the Mojo mirror
`src/C1_final_proof_block_ledger.mojo`, the block table of
`docs/C1_final_proof_block_ledger.md`, the claim entries, the index
`docs/C1_ledger_index.md`, the TLA+ ledger with its TLC models, and the typed
relationship graph `docs/C1_claim_relationship_graph.json` are all rendered
from it (`pixi run ledgers`). Whether the final object *requires* a block is
the dependency edge `C1 -> block`, not a field anyone sets. CI runs
`tools/make_ledger.py --check` beside the audit, so a hand-edited surface fails
the build rather than drifting. The `tools/audit_*.py` scripts remain the
executable record of the same rules until they are retired.

## Boundary of claims

This project does not claim an unconditional finite co-landing certificate for generic Mandelbrot boundary points. For generic boundary points, finite certificate streams can be produced, but their singleton stabilization is exactly the MLC/fiber-triviality frontier unless a new proof is supplied.

No finite bounded search, renderer, numerical picture, local carrier refinement, or terminology declaration proves C1 by itself.

## Status

Research scaffold with enforced terminology, rank-2 ontology, C1 proof-status gates, Mojo-first executable certificate policy, and a Mojo finite theorem-kernel boundary.
