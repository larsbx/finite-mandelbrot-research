# C1 obstruction extractor on Misiurewicz prefix graphs (round-two item R5).
# This file is terminology-governed by docs/C1_misiurewicz_prefix_graph.md; the
# term `prefix obstruction` is registered in docs/terminology-registry.md.
#
# Route F1 of docs/C1_F1_obstruction_extraction.md asks for a finite obstruction
# object that a rational-ray catalogue can see. The overlap route of
# larsbx/pisot-substitution-conjecture-research already extracts one on a finite
# graph (docs/p1-overlap-minimal-obstruction-2026-09-14.md,
# mojo/psc/overlap_obstruction.mojo). This runs the same pipeline on the graphs
# the exact-type catalogue of src/misiurewicz_catalogue.mojo supplies:
#
#   vertices      the forward orbit closure of a catalogue under doubling
#   pairs         the unordered non-diagonal pairs of vertices
#   productive    separated by the prefix now, or with a productive successor
#   nonproductive the rest: the pairs no iterate ever separates
#   sinks         the sink components of the nonproductive set, of two kinds
#   dichotomy     each *cyclic* sink is a boundary or an interior obstruction
#
# Productivity is computed backwards from the separated pairs, exactly as the
# overlap route computes it backwards from the coincidences. Forward closedness
# of the nonproductive set is then a lemma, not a computation: a nonproductive
# pair cannot have a productive successor, because a separation reached from the
# successor is reached from the pair one step earlier.
#
# Doubling is a function, so the pair graph has out-degree at most one and each
# component falls into exactly one cycle. The sink components are therefore the
# cycles, and no strongly-connected-component search is needed; this is where
# the mirror is simpler than the overlap route, whose graph branches.
#
# A merging pair, whose two points share an image, has no successor and is never
# separated, so it is nonproductive. Counting it productive would be the
# substantive error: those two addresses are precisely the ones doubling can
# never tell apart.
#
# A merging pair has no outgoing edge, so its component is a singleton nothing
# leaves: it is a **terminal sink**, not a transient vertex. The nonproductive
# set therefore has sinks of two kinds, and `merging` counts the terminal ones
# exactly. They are kept out of the boundary and interior counts on purpose,
# because that dichotomy asks whether a *cycle* meets a separator boundary and a
# terminal pair has no cycle to ask about. Forcing it into either bucket would
# report a third phenomenon, two addresses with a common image, as one of the
# two the overlap route named.
#
# The dichotomy transfers term by term from the overlap route. A cycle is a
# boundary obstruction when some point on it is a separator endpoint, so the
# object may lie on the separation line itself: the `BoundaryEqualityCandidate`
# of docs/C1_canonical_carrier_content.md and the aligned obstruction of the
# overlap route, where a child start coincides. Otherwise it is an interior
# obstruction: no separator boundary is ever hit, which is `CarrierTooCoarse`
# and the strict-zipper case, where one side advances at every step.
#
# Bounds and fail-closed behaviour: one constant governs the graph. Vertices
# live in `Z/den`, so `MAX_PREFIX_GRAPH_DENOMINATOR` caps the vertex count and
# the pair count together. A denominator past it, a malformed separator, and an
# out-of-range point are refused rather than computed. Rejection is sticky and
# is never an empty answer: an empty obstruction set is a positive verdict about
# a complete graph, so a bounded search that failed must not read as one. That
# is UW-2: a bounded failed search is not persistent evidence.
#
# Scope: this decides one prefix. It does not decide persistent non-separation,
# which quantifies over every prefix, and an empty obstruction set is not fibre
# triviality, which for this class is the imported tag `KnownTrivialFiberClass`.
# No PF-critical or full-rank check appears here, for the same reason it appears
# nowhere in the overlap route: those are proved invariants of the output, not
# filters this code applies.
