# C1 Misiurewicz exact-type catalogue

Status: definition-level finite catalogue with an exact counting regression; no theorem-status change.

This note discharges round-one item B6 of `docs/cross-pollination-round-two-2026-09-16.md`, recorded there as "the rationale was corrected, the catalogue object and the angle-count regression were not built". It supplies both. It is also the prerequisite the round-two document names for item R5, the obstruction extractor on Misiurewicz prefix graphs: that item needs a finite set of addresses per exact type before an extractor has anything to run on.

## Terminology declaration: exact-type catalogue

Genealogy: Misiurewicz parameters and their exact preperiod and period are standard in complex dynamics, and the reading of both off the denominator of a rational external angle is the standard symbolic fact about doubling. The catalogue is the finite set of those addresses for one type; the word carries no new mathematics.

Bridge claim: definition-only project term. The catalogue holds ray addresses, which are finite symbolic objects, not parameters and not points. Associating a parameter with an address needs a landing tag and an adapter; triviality of the corresponding fibres is the imported tag `KnownTrivialFiberClass` under its own hypotheses.

Known leaks: A catalogue is finite by construction and bounded by `MAX_CATALOGUE_DENOMINATOR`, a bound strictly stronger than the one `exact_type` enforces, so an accepted exact type may have no catalogue here; it is not a statement about all types, and an exhausted small type says nothing about a larger one. The counting identity is exact arithmetic, not evidence about the parameter plane.

Use discipline: Use in C1 files or with a pointer to this declaration, and only for sets of addresses. A catalogue does not locate a parameter, decide a fibre, or settle C1, and must not be written as if it did.

## Exact type

For a ray address `p/q` in lowest terms, write `q = 2^l m` with `m` odd. Under doubling modulo one the address has preperiod `l` and period the multiplicative order of `2` modulo `m`, with `m = 1` giving period one because zero is fixed. The address is of **Misiurewicz type** when `l >= 1`, that is, when the orbit is strictly preperiodic; `1/3` has preperiod zero and is periodic, so it is not, while `1/2` and `1/6` are.

`exact_type(num, den)` returns both indices and refuses an address outside `[0, 1)`, a non-positive denominator, and a denominator beyond the bound. Reduction happens first, so `2/6` is read as `1/3`.

## The catalogue and its counting identity

Every address of exact type `(l, k)` is `p / (2^l m)` in lowest terms with `m` odd of multiplicative order `k`, and every such `m` divides `2^k - 1`. The addresses therefore share the denominator

```text
catalogue_denominator(l, k) = 2^l (2^k - 1),
```

and counting them gives, since there are `phi(2^l m) = 2^(l-1) phi(m)` numerators for each `m` and the orders sum by Moebius inversion over the divisors of `2^k - 1`,

```text
count(l, k) = 2^(l-1) * sum_{d | k} mu(k/d) (2^d - 1).
```

`catalogue(l, k)` enumerates the numerators and `catalogue_matches_count(l, k)` compares the enumeration with the identity. That comparison is the round-one angle-count regression: the Mojo smoke target runs it for every type with `1 <= l, k <= 4`, and `tools/misiurewicz_catalogue_reference.py` for every type with `1 <= l, k <= 7`, forty-nine in all.

Pinned catalogues, asserted identically on both sides:

| Type `(l, k)` | Denominator | Addresses | Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `(1, 1)` | `2` | `1/2` | `1` |
| `(2, 1)` | `4` | `1/4, 3/4` | `2` |
| `(1, 2)` | `6` | `1/6, 5/6` | `2` |
| `(1, 3)` | `14` | `1/14, 3/14, 5/14, 9/14, 11/14, 13/14` | `6` |
| `(2, 3)` | `28` | twelve addresses | `12` |
| `(3, 3)` | `56` | twenty-four addresses | `24` |

## Bounds and fail-closed behaviour

Every bound is checked before any arithmetic, so no computation here can overflow its fixed-width integers, and a bound reached is a refusal, never an answer: `catalogue_denominator` returns `-1` and `catalogue` the empty list.

The two bounds govern different things, and conflating them is the trap this section exists to close. `exact_type` reads a type off any address whose denominator is at most `MAX_CATALOGUE_DENOMINATOR`, and refuses every other address; its loop is bounded by that denominator. A catalogue of type `(l, k)` needs more: both indices at most `MAX_TYPE_INDEX`, *and* its own denominator `2^l (2^k - 1)` within the same bound, which is far more restrictive.

So an accepted type need not be one this module holds a catalogue of, and each bound has a witness well inside the denominator limit:

| Address | Exact type | Why no catalogue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1/58` | `(1, 28)` | the period exceeds `MAX_TYPE_INDEX` |
| `1/50` | `(1, 20)` | both indices are inside the index bound, but `2 (2^20 - 1)` exceeds `MAX_CATALOGUE_DENOMINATOR` |

`catalogueable_type(l, k)` answers the catalogue question directly. Read catalogueability off it, never off `exact_type` accepting an address.

## Non-claims

`catalogue_is_a_set_of_parameters()` and `catalogue_proves_fibre_triviality()` return `False`. The catalogue is a finite set of symbolic addresses. It locates nothing, and the triviality of the fibres of Misiurewicz parameters remains the imported theorem tag with its stated hypotheses.

## Next step

Round-two item R5 is built: `docs/C1_misiurewicz_prefix_graph.md` runs the obstruction extractor of `docs/C1_F1_obstruction_extraction.md` on the graphs a catalogue supplies.

**Do not pair a catalogue's own addresses into separators.** This section said to, and that recipe is wrong twice over. A separator needs accepted landing tags on both rays and a declared co-landing pair (`docs/C1_admissible_separator_codes.md`), which addresses alone cannot supply; and pairing a catalogue's addresses puts every vertex in its own arc, so the result restates the construction rather than testing the imported triviality tag. The first implementation of R5 did exactly this and the claim was withdrawn in review.

The open step is therefore a genuine negative control for this class, which needs separators whose co-landing is declared rather than derived from the points being separated.
