# Mojo-first execution and theorem-kernel policy

Status: repository policy.

Terminology used here is governed by `docs/terminology-registry.md`.

Mojo is the default first-class language for executable finite-regime computations **and** for the finite proof-object theorem kernel in finite-mandlebrot-research.

This does not mean Mojo re-proves the analytic literature. It means the repository’s trusted internal checker for finite algebraic, combinatorial, separator-catalogue, witness, and carrier-refinement derivations is written in Mojo.

## Arithmetic contract

Every integer, rational, and interval kernel Mojo owns is bound by
`docs/rational-interval-arithmetic-spec.md`: exact normalized `Q` for
equality and order, rational-endpoint intervals for enclosure, three-valued
interval signs, filter-then-exact fallback, and no floating point in any
certificate path. `tools/audit_exact_arithmetic.py` enforces the binding
table in CI; the quarantined `Float64` demo files are listed in
`tools/exact_arithmetic_allowlist.md`.

## What Mojo owns

Mojo should be the primary implementation language for:

- integer/rational arithmetic adapters;
- rank-2 coordinate-record arithmetic;
- quadrance scalar computations;
- interval and polynomial kernels;
- separator-code normalization;
- finite separator-catalogue scans;
- witness structs and status structs;
- canonical certificate encodings;
- performance-critical finite combinatorics;
- finite proof-object syntax;
- finite proof-rule checking;
- theorem-tag import validation;
- proof-grade derivation replay.

Python remains acceptable for:

- CI linting;
- reference oracles;
- repository audits;
- test harnesses while Mojo tooling matures;
- migration scaffolds.

Python must not become the source of truth for certificate computation or proof-object validity once a Mojo implementation exists.

A Python test must not assert what Mojo does by reading Mojo source. Matching
a source substring says the text is present, not that the computation ran or
that it returned what the test expects, and it breaks on any rewrite that
preserves behaviour. Run the smoke suite and assert the verdict of the named
case instead: `tests/conftest.py` exposes `mojo_smoke`, which runs
`src/smoke_tests.mojo` once per session and parses the cases it names. Reading
source is still right for what is genuinely a property of the text, such as
the absence of floating-point literals or the presence of a regime-
correspondence marker.

Every case of the Mojo smoke suite is named and reported through
`src/smoke_report.mojo`, and every case runs even after one fails, so a single
run names every broken contract. A case name that is a governed term is used
in the sense the terminology registry gives it.

## Mojo theorem kernel boundary

The Mojo theorem kernel is a small proof checker for finite derivations. It owns:

```text
ProofObject + RuleApplication + LocalAxiomTag + TheoremTagImport
  -> CheckedTheoremStatus
```

It may check project-internal finite statements such as:

- normalized rational-address validity;
- separator-code admissibility;
- finite-prefix existential separation;
- side-witness composition;
- canonical carrier-content comparison;
- strict carrier-refinement descent;
- proof-status propagation.

It must not silently assert analytic conclusions. Classical complex-dynamics results enter only as theorem tags with source metadata and declared assumptions.

## Trusted imports

A theorem tag is not an internal proof. It is an explicit import boundary.

Every imported theorem tag must carry:

- stable theorem identifier;
- source family or citation key;
- hypotheses required by the source theorem;
- conclusion made available to the finite kernel;
- leak note stating what the source theorem does not provide.

The Mojo kernel may verify that a finite derivation used an allowed theorem tag under declared hypotheses. It does not turn an unchecked tag into an internally proved theorem.

## Optimization discipline

Mojo implementations should prefer:

- value-like structs with explicit fields;
- normalized integer/rational representations;
- contiguous arrays or fixed-layout records where possible;
- explicit branch-minimized inner kernels;
- separation of debug/demo paths from proof-grade paths;
- allocation-light polynomial evaluation;
- Horner evaluation for polynomial kernels;
- batchable vector-style loops for catalogue and interval checks;
- clear backend boundaries for arbitrary-precision integer support;
- deterministic proof replay with no ambient mutable global theorem state.

## Layer rule for R2

At the R2 certificate layer, Mojo code may expose:

- coordinate records;
- coefficient operations;
- polynomial operations;
- polynomial predicates;
- quadrance scalar computations.

It must not expose primitive constructors, APIs, or inference rules for:

- circle;
- disk;
- arc;
- circumference;
- polar angle;
- connected component;
- interior;
- boundary;
- analytic locus.

These concepts may appear only through a registered higher-layer adapter.

## Naming rule

New C1 proof code should use:

```text
SeparatorCatalogueSoundness
SeparatorCatalogueCompleteness
SeparatorCatalogueAdequacy
```

rather than `catalogue extensionality`.

Legacy files may mention the old term only as migration history.
