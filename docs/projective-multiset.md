# Projective multisets and the infinity divisor

**Status:** exact finite-field definition and implementation contract. This
document proves no claim about Mandelbrot local connectivity and does not
identify a finite-field shadow with the classical Mandelbrot set.

The source definition is fixed in `docs/mandelbrot-defining-family.md`. The
Mandelbrot set is the non-escaping parameter locus of the marked critical
section for `f_c(z) = z^2 + c`. The construction below starts only after
reduction to finite-field functional graphs and must not be read as a second
definition of that set.

## Projective quadratic morphism

For a field `K` and parameter `c`, the polynomial recurrence `z |-> z^2 + c`
extends to the morphism

```text
F_c [X:Z] = [X^2 + c Z^2 : Z^2]
```

on the projective line. The projective class `infinity = [1:0]` is fixed. Its
pullback divisor is

```text
F_c^* [infinity] = 2 [infinity],
(F_c^n)^* [infinity] = 2^n [infinity].
```

This is an exact algebraic statement: infinity is totally ramified. In the
local parameter `w = Z/X`, the transformed coordinate is

```text
w |-> w^2 / (1 + c w^2),
```

so its vanishing order at `w = 0` doubles. This is the projective algebraic
content behind attraction to infinity; it requires no circle, transcendental
function, metric limit, or analytic complex-number primitive.

For finite `c` the affine chart is invariant. Consequently, an affine orbit
over `F_q` never lands on the infinity divisor, even though the divisor and
its ramification are algebraically meaningful. The following statements must
therefore remain distinct:

1. affine landing at infinity, which does not occur here;
2. intersection multiplicity with the infinity divisor in a projective
   closure;
3. pullback multiplicity of the invariant infinity divisor;
4. pole-order growth at a valuation over a function or global field.

Only items 1 and 3 are implemented in the first finite-field slice.

## Effective zero-cycles

A finite projective multiset is represented mathematically as an effective
zero-cycle

```text
D = sum_v m_v [v],     m_v in N.
```

Its support is the set of projective classes with nonzero coefficient. A
coefficient must always declare its semantics. Basin cardinality, witness
count, polynomial-root multiplicity, intersection multiplicity, and
extension-field fibre cardinality are different invariants and are not
interchangeable.

The first executable coefficient is the **critical-basin multiplicity**

```text
b_p(c) = #{z in F_p : the eventual cycle of z equals the critical cycle}.
```

It is graded by the exact critical-orbit signature `(tail, period)`. Hence one
weighted arithmetic-shadow zero-cycle is

```text
D_p = sum_{c in F_p} b_p(c) [c:1]_(tail(c), period(c)).
```

This enriches finite functional-graph statistics. It is not a finite
Mandelbrot support: the classical boundedness predicate accepts every finite
orbit and therefore distinguishes no residue parameters. Any relation between
this zero-cycle and the classical parameter locus requires a separate bridge
theorem.

## Extension fields

Over extensions, a zero-cycle defined over `F_q` may contain a full Frobenius
orbit of projective classes even when its individual classes are not rational
over `F_q`. A later extension-field implementation must therefore encode
Frobenius-stable cycles, not merely lists of `F_q`-rational classes.

## Claim firewall

The following do not yet follow from the implemented basin multiset without a
bridge theorem:

- an escape classification of the classical parameter plane;
- a finite-field replacement for the classical Mandelbrot set;
- local connectivity, fibre triviality, or landing of external rays;
- an analytic basin measure;
- a theorem transferring a finite-field multiplicity distribution to
  characteristic zero.

These are open bridge targets rather than excluded uses. Each requires its own
theorem tag, hypotheses, and source record. The concrete bridge ladder is in
`docs/multiset-bridge-program.md`; in particular, algebraic multiplicity of
critical-relation divisors has a more direct lifting route than basin
cardinality, while both remain available coefficient semantics.

## Executable contract

`src/projective_multiset.mojo` provides:

- exact critical tail and period over a caller-supplied prime field;
- exact critical-basin cardinality;
- one graded effective-zero-cycle coefficient per parameter;
- the bounded exact identity `mult_infinity((F_c^n)^*[infinity]) = 2^n`;
- fail-closed rejection outside the fixed-width multiplicity bound;
- the theorem-level invariant that affine polynomial orbits do not land on
  the infinity divisor.

The module currently treats primality as an explicit caller precondition and
rejects moduli above its declared fixed-width execution bound. Supporting
general prime powers requires a finite-field representation and is not
silently approximated by arithmetic modulo a composite integer.
