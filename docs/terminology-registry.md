# Terminology Registry

Status: controlled vocabulary registry.

This registry exists so the research program does not drift into private jargon. Mathematical language should be recognizable in the field. Project-specific names are allowed only when their status is explicit.

## Established field terms

These terms may be used without a project terminology declaration, provided they are used in their ordinary field sense:

- Mandelbrot set
- Mandelbrot local connectivity
- MLC
- fiber
- trivial fiber
- rational external ray
- parameter ray
- landing
- Misiurewicz parameter
- parabolic parameter
- hyperbolic component
- wake
- kneading sequence
- orbit portrait
- cyclic order
- dyadic box
- interval arithmetic
- Krawczyk method
- squarefree polynomial
- rational address
- doubling map
- quadrance
- spread
- incidence relation
- vertex
- theorem tag

## Project terms with declarations

### PointVertex

Terminology declaration: `PointVertex` is a project term for a finite incidence object whose carrier is a finite set of vertices.

Genealogy: It comes from incidence-geometry language and the user's project rule that a point is a vertex of vertices. It is not the analytic point of complex dynamics.

Bridge claim: Definition-only project term. It is not claimed to be isomorphic to a classical point.

Known leaks: A classical point can carry topological and analytic structure; `PointVertex` carries only finite incidence data. It cannot by itself express neighborhoods, connectedness, metric distance, or local connectivity.

Use discipline: Use only for finite certificate carriers such as root handles, ray-address sets, and dyadic boxes. Do not use as an analytic singleton.

### rank-2 coordinate record

Terminology declaration: A rank-2 coordinate record is a finite pair `(x,y)` with polynomial operations such as `(x,y) star (u,v) = (xu-yv, xv+yu)`.

Genealogy: It is inherited from coordinate algebra for the quadratic family and from rational-trigonometry style use of quadrance and spread. It is also the finite-regime replacement for informal complex-number language inside the certificate core.

Bridge claim: Conditional formal translation, not an ontological identification. Classical complex arithmetic can be translated into rank-2 polynomial arithmetic for the operations used in certificates.

Known leaks: The record does not supply analytic topology, limits, circles, disks, arcs, arguments, or measured angles. At rank 2, a circle is undefined; `Q(x,y)=r` is only a polynomial constraint unless lifted to a higher incidence/constraint layer.

Use discipline: Use for polynomial recurrence, quadrance, determinant, spread, and operator matrices only.

### finite rational-ray nest

Terminology declaration: A finite rational-ray nest is a finite prefix of certified rational-ray separator data around incidence objects.

Genealogy: It is derived from Schleicher-style fiber definitions using rational rays and separation, plus finite certificate and interval-refinement practice.

Bridge claim: Conditional bridge theorem target. Under `SeparatorCatalogueAdequacy`, the finite stream of separator prefixes matches the classical rational-ray separation relation.

Known leaks: A finite prefix is not a classical fiber. Absence of separation in one prefix does not prove same fiber. Stabilization of all prefixes requires an additional global argument with MLC-strength unless restricted to established cases.

Use discipline: Use only with an explicit prefix level or stream-level quantifier.

### SeparatorCatalogueAdequacy

Terminology declaration: `SeparatorCatalogueAdequacy` is the project term for the two-sided bridge between finite separator-catalogue prefixes and the classical rational-ray separation relation used in fiber theory.

Genealogy: It packages standard rational-ray separation, wake combinatorics, orbit portraits, kneading data, and finite rational-address encodings. It replaces the deprecated phrase `catalogue extensionality`.

Bridge claim: Conditional bridge theorem. It follows only from separate proofs of `SeparatorCatalogueSoundness` and `SeparatorCatalogueCompleteness`.

Known leaks: Adequacy of the separator catalogue does not prove all fibers are trivial. It does not prove local connectivity, puzzle-piece shrinkage, a priori bounds, or MLC. It only aligns the finite separation predicate with the classical separation predicate.

Use discipline: Use for the two-sided bridge. Use `SeparatorCatalogueSoundness` for finite-to-classical and `SeparatorCatalogueCompleteness` for classical-to-finite. Do not use it as evidence that C1 is solved.

### persistent non-separation

Terminology declaration: Persistent non-separation is the meta-level condition `forall k, not Separated_k(A,B)`.

Genealogy: It comes from the classical definition of fibers as equivalence classes under non-separation by rational rays, translated through separator-catalogue prefixes.

Bridge claim: Conditional bridge theorem target, not a finite computation. It becomes classical same-fiber only after `SeparatorCatalogueAdequacy` is proved and invoked.

Known leaks: No bounded search establishes it. It does not imply singleton fibers, local connectivity, or C1 by itself.

Use discipline: Always state the universal-prefix quantifier. Never use it as a synonym for same fiber unless the needed bridge theorem is explicitly invoked.

### persistent wake ambiguity

Terminology declaration: Persistent wake ambiguity is a structured obstruction candidate extracted from persistent non-separation when unresolved wake-side evidence appears cofinally.

Genealogy: It comes from wake decompositions in parameter-space combinatorics and the project’s finite side-assignment witnesses.

Bridge claim: Proof-route abstraction, not an established field term or theorem.

Known leaks: Wake ambiguity may be an artifact of incomplete separator catalogues, missing landing tags, or inadequate side-witness extraction. It must not be treated as a classical obstruction until those alternatives are discharged.

Use discipline: Use only inside F1 obstruction extraction and WakeAmbiguityElimination documents.

### Mojo theorem kernel

Terminology declaration: `Mojo theorem kernel` is the project term for a small trusted checker for finite proof objects, rule applications, and certificate derivations written in Mojo.

Genealogy: It follows LCF-style proof-kernel discipline and proof-carrying certificate systems, but is specialized to this repository's finite algebraic and combinatorial proof objects.

Bridge claim: Definition-only project architecture with a future implementation target. It does not make Mojo a replacement for classical complex-dynamics literature. External analytic theorems enter only as explicit theorem tags or axioms with source metadata.

Known leaks: The kernel can check finite derivations encoded in its rule set. It cannot by itself prove analytic landing theorems, MLC, puzzle shrinkage, a priori bounds, or fiber triviality for generic boundary parameters.

Use discipline: Use Mojo as the first-class computation language and the first-class finite proof-object checker. Do not treat an unchecked theorem tag as a proved internal theorem.

## Deprecated project terms

- `catalogue extensionality`: deprecated. Use `SeparatorCatalogueAdequacy`, `SeparatorCatalogueSoundness`, or `SeparatorCatalogueCompleteness`.

## Banned rank-2 locus language

At rank 2, do not use the following as primitives:

- circle
- unit circle
- disk
- arc
- circumference
- point locus
- angular coordinate
- polar coordinate

Allowed replacement language:

- polynomial constraint
- quadrance equation
- finite incidence carrier
- higher-rank constraint object
- rational address interval

## Novel bridge checklist

Any new term claiming to connect two fields must include the five headings:

1. `Terminology declaration`
2. `Genealogy`
3. `Bridge claim`
4. `Known leaks`
5. `Use discipline`

Any phrase such as `isomorphic to`, `equivalent to`, `same as`, `analogue of`, or `bridge between` must state whether it is:

- theorem-backed;
- conditional on named lemmas;
- definition-only;
- analogy/metaphor.
