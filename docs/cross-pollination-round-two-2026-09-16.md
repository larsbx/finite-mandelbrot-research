# Cross-pollination, round two: PSC, NLAP-JT, finite-math-kernels, and four adjacent repositories

**Status:** comparative audit dated 2026-09-16, continuing `docs/cross-program-bridge-psc-nlapjt-2026-09-12.md`. It records what round one produced, what the overlap route now makes visible between the two research programs, and which of the user's other repositories share structure with them. It proves nothing, promotes no claim, and changes no ledger. Status labels follow section 0.2 of the round-one document. Project terms are governed by `docs/terminology-registry.md` in the Mandelbrot program and by `claim_governance.toml` in PSC. That program moved from `larsbx/NLAP-JT` to `larsbx/finite-mandlebrot-research` on 2026-09-16; the prefix `NLAP:` below is kept as this document's path prefix for it, and the old repository receives no new work.

Repositories read in this session, all at their `main` heads on 2026-09-16:

| Tag | Repository | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PSC:` | `larsbx/pisot-substitution-conjecture-research` @ `6b0b577` | research program, overlap route |
| `NLAP:` | `larsbx/finite-mandlebrot-research` @ `5a2f404` | research program, finite separation certificates. Read at `larsbx/NLAP-JT` @ `d00c64d` when this audit was written, and migrated on 2026-09-16 with that history carried over; every `NLAP:` commit cited below resolves in the successor |
| `FMK:` | `larsbx/finite-math-kernels` @ `807ae7e` | monorepo consolidating `finite_exact`, `finite_linear_algebra`, `substitution_dynamics`, `proof_records`, `audit/claim_governance`; the six source repositories are retired with provenance |
| `SG:` | `larsbx/sprucegoose` | Elixir/Ash orchestration control plane with a content-addressed constitutional kernel |
| `CC:` | `larsbx/crypto-composer` | Zig composition-graph checker with proof-driven tests |
| `TS:` | `larsbx/tui-story` | Elixir semantic-relationship graph with TLA+ specifications |
| `ORM:` | `larsbx/objective-review-metasytem` | manifestos with machine-readable rulings, Vale and GitHub integrations |

`larsbx/coop_substrate` is private and was not read. Markers: `[V]` verified here by reading or executing; `[L]` literature statement that must be pinned before any ledger uses it.

## 0. Round-one ledger `[V]`

| Round-one item | State on 2026-09-16 | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 overlap transport of `G1b-2` | adopted and surpassed: seed-patch overlap graph finite by bounded discrepancy (Theorem 2.1 / manuscript 4.22); coincidence density and dense-good-set equivalence (Lemma 5.36); Barge–Štimac–Williams imported; the route's single open premise is `OverlapProductivity` | the open gate itself; G1b-2 demoted to a parallel program |
| B2 one Galois lemma for both | NLAP corrected §3 (PR #8); PSC resolved the source question by irreducibility of the exterior-square characteristic polynomial (`docs/galois-aux-b-source-resolution-2026-09-13.md`), so the Galois step is no longer a separate theorem | the Lean layer is unchanged (six files, no Galois or exterior-square lemma), so the irreducibility statement is proved in prose only |
| B3 TLA+ ledger port to NLAP | not done; NLAP built Mojo ledgers (`C1_final_proof_block_ledger`, theorem-tag import ledger, payload instances) and FMK shipped `proof_records` instead | see R2: generate every ledger from proof records |
| B4 NLAP Mojo toolchain and CI | done: Mojo 1.0.0 pinned, compiled closure of 36 modules, smoke, property probe, all audits, full pytest; CI green | modules outside the closure remain (`mojo_theorem_kernel.mojo`, `canonical_serialization.mojo`) |
| B5 per-instance certificates and import metadata | partial: `claim_governance.toml` gives PSC a status vocabulary with an `imported` class enforced across five surfaces; `tla/ProofArchitecture.tla` still has no `Imported` set; issue #2 (deterministic census export) still open | R2 |
| B6 exact-type catalogue and counting identity | done 2026-09-16 (`NLAP: 5a2f404`): `src/misiurewicz_catalogue.mojo` reads the exact type off the reduced denominator, enumerates the catalogue of each *catalogueable* type, and checks it against the angle-count identity, with a Python oracle and a doubling-map cross-check. Catalogueability is strictly stronger than the type being readable: `1/58` is of exact type `(1, 28)` and `1/50` of type `(1, 20)`, and neither type has a catalogue here | none; it was the prerequisite R5 had been waiting on |
| B7 shared real times 2-adic box kernel | partial: `PSC: mojo/psc/finite_cokernel_address.mojo` computes `Z^3 / M^k Z^3` classes; no p-adic module in FMK. **Post-audit, 2026-09-17:** a carrier landed as `FMK: bd68d11`, though not in B7's own terms, since its gate refuted the scalar reading: one `Z_p` ball per rational prime cannot model `Z^3 / M^k Z^3`, which is `Z/2 x Z/2` at `k = 2` where a precision-two `Z_2` ball is cyclic. `FMK: finite_linear_algebra/madic_ball.mojo` carries cosets of `M^k Z^n` instead, and certifies separation only | R7, which stays open on this item: a carrier is not the step it serves. The local-field factor over `Q(beta)` stays unbuilt on purpose |
| B8 Hubbard-tree core-entropy census | not done | R7 |
| B9 PSC firewall linter and terminology registry | partial: `claim_governance` runs in CI with risky-phrase and no-float rules; PSC deliberately keeps no terminology registry (`claim_governance.toml` comment) | R6 |
| B10 NLAP gate green | done | none |

Two round-one predictions were confirmed by later independent audits: `NLAP: docs/project-audit-2026-09-14.md` F2 and F9 reproduce C3 and C1 of the bridge document; `PSC: docs/audit-2026-09-15.md` F8 asks that cross-repository paths be qualified, which this document does.

## 1. What the overlap route now makes visible between the two programs

### N1. NLAP's residual class is substitution dynamics `[L]`, and FMK already ships the kernel `[V]`

The NLAP theorem-tag ledger now names its residual class exactly: after `YoccozPuzzleLocalConnectivityUnderHypotheses` (non-renormalizable and finitely renormalizable parameters) and the Misiurewicz, parabolic, and hyperbolic-boundary tags, persistent non-separation between distinct parameters can only occur inside the infinitely renormalizable class (`NLAP: docs/C1_theorem_tag_import_ledger.md`, "Renormalization with a priori bounds", strength class `CLASSICAL_IMPORTED_CLASS_SPECIFIC`).

That class has a finite-combinatorial description that is literally the object of `FMK: substitution_dynamics`:

- Douady–Hubbard tuning by a centre of period `p` acts on kneading sequences as a constant-length-`p` substitution on the two-letter itinerary alphabet; an infinitely renormalizable parameter is described by an infinite directive sequence of such substitutions, and its kneading sequence is the corresponding S-adic limit `[L]`.
- The restriction of `f_c` to the postcritical set of an infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomial of bounded type is an odometer, and the itinerary subshift is an almost one-to-one extension of it `[L]`. That is the two-letter, constant-length instance of the PSC objects: the odometer is the maximal equicontinuous factor, and "almost one-to-one" is coincidence rank one. For constant-length substitutions the coincidence criterion is Dekking's theorem `[L]`.

Consequences.

1. Two infinitely renormalizable parameters lie in one Schleicher fibre only if they share the entire directive sequence (every finite prefix is decided by rational-ray separators at the corresponding renormalization level) `[L]`. So NLAP's `PersistentNonSeparation(A,B)` on the residual class is the statement "same S-adic directive sequence", and the "carrier" NLAP has been trying to define abstractly is a directive sequence with a finite prefix at each stage. Carrier refinement is one more renormalization level, which is one more substitution in the directive sequence.
2. The frontier comparison becomes precise rather than analogical: PSC's open gate asks whether a Pisot inflation hierarchy forces coincidence (fibre collapse in the tiling space); the open part of MLC asks whether a renormalization hierarchy of unbounded combinatorics forces the nested tuned copies to shrink (fibre collapse in parameter space). Both are "does hierarchical self-similarity force collapse", and in both the bounded-type case is a theorem and the unbounded case is the frontier. Leak: the substitution picture describes the *dynamical* plane of a residual parameter; the *parameter-plane* shrinking needs a priori bounds, which no substitution computation supplies. The dictionary organizes the frontier; it does not move it.
3. Executable deliverable: a `tuning(p, kneading_word)` constructor in `FMK: substitution_dynamics/substitution.mojo` (the API already takes an arbitrary alphabet size `[V]`), a Dekking coincidence check for constant-length substitutions (a special case of the existing balanced-pair machinery), and, in NLAP, a residual-class carrier represented as a directive-sequence prefix rather than an untyped incidence record. NLAP's exact rational-angle machinery (`checked_ray_address`, `bigq_ray_address`) already computes the kneading data the constructor needs.

Status: the tuning-as-substitution and odometer facts are THEOREM-grade in the literature and must be pinned (Douady–Hubbard; Milnor's orbit portraits; Dekking 1978; Lyubich's renormalization papers for the odometer statement). The reformulation of the residual carrier is DEFINITION-level. The frontier comparison is ANALOGY with the leak stated.

### N2. Coincidence density has a parameter-space twin, and there it is a theorem `[L]`

The overlap route now carries a quantitative fibre-collapse measure: the common fraction `f_m(T)` and its limit `delta(T)`, with `delta(s) = 1` for one legal seed sufficient for pure discrete spectrum through the imported Barge–Štimac–Williams theorem. The measure-theoretic conclusion suffices because pure discrete spectrum is itself a measure-theoretic statement.

NLAP's natural measure is harmonic measure on the boundary of `M`, that is, Lebesgue measure on external angles. The literature reports that for harmonic-measure-almost every boundary parameter the Mandelbrot set is locally connected at that parameter and the fibre is trivial (Graczyk–Świątek, *Harmonic measure and expansion on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set*; Smirnov, *Symbolic dynamics and Collet–Eckmann conditions*) `[L]`. If that pin holds, NLAP has a measure-one island exactly where PSC has its density theorem, and MLC differs from it by a harmonic-measure-zero set that contains the infinitely renormalizable parameters of N1. The correct NLAP statement is then

```text
PersistentNonSeparation(A,B) and A != B  =>  A, B in a harmonic-measure-null class
```

as an imported theorem tag with an explicit measure-zero scope, not a triviality claim.

Deliverable: one theorem-tag record `HarmonicMeasureAlmostEveryFibreTrivial` with source, hypotheses, and the leak "measure zero is not empty", and a `density` field on NLAP carriers giving the angle measure of the separated set at prefix `k`, the analogue of PSC's `f_m`. Status: THEOREM-grade in the literature pending the pin; the carrier field is DEFINITION.

### N3. PSC's obstruction normal form is NLAP's F1 route, executed `[V]`

`PSC: docs/p1-overlap-minimal-obstruction-2026-09-14.md` and `mojo/psc/overlap_obstruction.mojo` do, on a finite graph, what `NLAP: docs/C1_F1_obstruction_extraction.md` describes abstractly: take the forward-closed nonproductive set, extract a sink SCC, prove it PF-critical and full-rank, split it by a dichotomy, and retain the smallest countermodel with a fail-closed extractor. The dichotomy transfers term by term:

| PSC (overlap graph) | NLAP (separator catalogue) |
| --- | --- |
| aligned obstruction: `(i,j,0)` in `S`, an explicitly non-eventually-coincident letter pair | `BoundaryEqualityCandidate`: the object may lie on the separator |
| strict-zipper obstruction: no zero-shift state, one side advances at each boundary | `CarrierTooCoarse` / interior wake ambiguity: no separator boundary is hit |
| `common_child_start_count` exact boundary-hit test | side-assignment witness extraction |
| `nonproductive_sink_sccs` fails closed on capped graphs | `UW-2`: a bounded failed search is not persistent evidence |

The transfer is concrete because NLAP now has finite graphs to run it on: for the Misiurewicz class, the exact-type catalogue of round-one B6, built on 2026-09-16, gives a finite set of ray addresses per `(l,k)`, and the forward orbit closure of those addresses under doubling is the graph the extractor takes as its vertices (`NLAP: d8dfa45`). The separators are a separate input and do not come from the catalogue: the extractor takes a declared prefix whose separators each carry a landing tag, and refuses an untagged one.

**Correction, 2026-09-16.** The rest of this paragraph, as first written, was wrong, and building R5 is what exposed it. It said that the catalogue's rational-angle separators "form a finite catalogue prefix" and that the extractor would therefore yield "its first executable negative control of the PSC kind". Neither holds. A catalogue supplies ray addresses, and `docs/C1_admissible_separator_codes.md` requires a separator to carry accepted landing tags on both rays and a declared co-landing pair, which addresses alone cannot supply. Worse, pairing a catalogue's own addresses puts every vertex in its own arc, so the resulting "control" restates the construction rather than testing the imported triviality tag. The first implementation did exactly that and the claim was withdrawn in review. **No negative control for this class is available yet**, and one will need separators whose co-landing is declared, not derived from the points being separated. Status: DEFINITION for the table; the extractor is built, the negative control is not.

### N4. Krawczyk for Perron enclosures `[V]`

PSC encloses the Perron root by an integer sign-change bracket and rational bisection (`mojo/psc/perron_interval.mojo`), with a Sturm–Tarski fallback for sign decisions. NLAP's compiled `checked_krawczyk_witness.mojo` and the BigZ interval layer now vendored through FMK give a certified contraction with uniqueness and quadratic convergence. A Krawczyk step on the cubic at the bisection bracket would shrink the enclosure that the overlap-interval audit reports as "interval-certified" and reduce the fallback count in `overlap_interval_audit`. Small, mechanical, and the first place a NLAP kernel would run inside PSC's proof-relevant path.

## 2. Adjacent repositories

### A1. Three content-addressed evidence ledgers `[V]`

| Concept | `SG:` kernel | `FMK: proof_records` | `CC:` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity | `ContentID`, SHA-256 of canonical bytes; `Canonical` with sorted string-keyed maps | `record_id` verified against a preimage that excludes it; length-prefixed fields, maps prohibited | `MANIFEST.SHA256` over tracked files |
| statement unit | `Proposition` (predicate, referent, input identity) | `Record.statement` and `scope` | test name plus `Proof{statement, argument, constraints}` |
| evidence | `Evidence` committed by a certified historical event | `evidence` keys per kind: `replay`, `digest`, `source`, `hypotheses_checked`, `domain` | `requireProof`, `tdd_ledger` red/green rows with command and exit code |
| derived claim | `Claim → Justification → Norm/Grant → Resolution → Authorization` | dependency closure over identity-bearing edges | constraint findings C1–C6 |
| outcome vocabulary | `Source/static PASS`, `Boot-free behavioral PASS`, `Dirty build exercise` (non-transferable), `Transferable clean release`, `UNEXECUTED` (neither PASS nor FAIL) | `accepted`, `bounded`, `incomplete`, `open`, `refuted`, `rejected` | `red`, `green` |
| authority separation | constitutive / historical / evidentiary / derived planes; a projection never authorizes | policy is consumer-supplied; bounded evidence never closes a general claim | proof statement required before a test may exist |

Sprucegoose's `UNEXECUTED` is PSC's "a capped run is inconclusive, never a counterexample" and `proof_records`' `incomplete`; its `Dirty build exercise: non-transferable` is `bounded_experiment`; its "derived plane is never accepted as authority input" is the rule PSC's `claim_governance` enforces by checking five hand-maintained status surfaces against one ledger. The three systems were written for orchestration, mathematics, and cryptography and converge on the same shape.

Opportunities, in order of cost:

1. **One canonical encoding.** Three incompatible canonical byte encodings exist for the same idea (sorted-key JSON in SG, length-prefixed no-map records in FMK, ordered-field envelopes in `NLAP: docs/canonical-serialization.md`). FMK's is the most restrictive and already has golden vectors (`fixtures/vectors.json`). Cross-test SG's `Canonical` against those vectors, or adopt FMK's codec for SG evidence receipts. `FMK: audit/POST_CONSOLIDATION_AUDIT_2026-09-15.md` FMK-AUDIT-001 says the FMK identity contract is itself still lagging its specification, so this is the moment to converge rather than after each hardens separately.
2. **One outcome vocabulary.** Map SG's five evidence classes onto `proof_records`' six states and record the map in both repositories; SG's release-provenance receipts then become `verified_finite_computation` records and PSC's CI census runs become SG-style receipts. The research repositories gain the historical plane they lack (their CI history is not a ledger today), and SG gains a validated dependency-closure algorithm it currently implements inside `Workflows.Graph` for a different DAG.
3. **Authority planes as documentation structure.** Rewrite `PSC: docs/verification-architecture.md` and `NLAP: docs/mojo-toolchain-boundary.md` in SG's four-plane vocabulary: constitutive (ledgers, policies, manuscripts), historical (CI runs, census outputs with digests), evidentiary (retained countermodels, replay vectors), derived (README counts, status tables). The claim-governance consistency check then has a stated principle: derived surfaces are regenerated, never edited.

### A2. Proof-driven tests link tests to claims `[V]`

`CC: test/harness.zig` refuses a test without a proof statement, argument, and the constraint identifiers it guards, and `tdd_ledger.zig` records every red/green transition with command and exit code. The research repositories have the same intent (AGENTS.md review gate: "Mojo regression coverage for the theorem/invariant contract") but no mechanism: nothing links a `mojo/tests/test_*.mojo` to the claim in `claim_governance.toml` or the node in `tla/Ledger.tla` it supports. A `claim_id` argument on each Mojo test (the PSC analogue of `requireProof`) and a check that every `proved` claim names at least one passing test would close that gap and make FMK-AUDIT-style audits mechanical. Conversely, `tdd_ledger` is a `proof_records` instance with two kinds and no dependency closure; crypto-composer would gain closure validation and bounded-versus-general discipline by consuming the FMK package, and the library-extraction audit already named it as a consumer of the canonical integer encoding.

### A3. Typed relationship graphs and the bridge vocabulary `[V]`

`TS:` stores concept relationships with nine typed edges (contradictory, implicative, hierarchical, evolutionary, analogous, synonymous, antonymous, part-whole, causal) and a certainty score, checked by `specs/SemanticGraphConstraints.tla`. The research repositories store the same kind of object as prose: NLAP's terminology declarations (genealogy, bridge claim, known leaks, use discipline), its `spec/regime_correspondences.toml` (class, status, preserves, does not inherit, domain conditions), the round-one correspondence table with THEOREM / CONDITIONAL / DEFINITION / ANALOGY labels, and PSC's status surfaces.

Two transfers:

1. **Export the registries as a typed graph.** `regime_correspondences.toml` entries are `analogous` or `implicative` edges with a status; terminology declarations are `synonymous`/`analogous` edges with declared leaks; contradictory status statements across surfaces (round-one C5: "routes around the contracting space" against "contracting address is the live target") are `contradictory` edges. A `TS:` graph built from the two ledgers would make such contradictions a queryable edge type instead of an audit finding. The `TS:` MCP server mode makes that graph available to the review agents already used on these repositories.
2. **Import provenance into the graph.** `TS:` edges are LLM-asserted with a certainty score and no provenance class. The research repositories' four-way status (theorem-backed, conditional on named lemmas, definition-only, analogy) and the "known leaks" field are exactly what an LLM-derived semantic graph lacks. Adding `provenance` and `leaks` attributes to the `TS:` edge schema, with the TLA+ constraint that a `synonymous` or `implicative` edge of provenance `theorem-backed` must name its source, would let the same graph carry verified and speculative relationships without conflating them.

### A4. Manifestos and prose linting `[V]`

`ORM:` publishes manifestos with machine-readable rulings (OBLIGATORY / ENCOURAGED / OPTIONAL / DISCOURAGED / PROHIBITED), a `semantic-relationships.yaml` between manifestos, Vale styles, and a GitHub workflow example; its Formal Verification Manifesto stops at software. The research repositories are a working instance of proof-carrying research hygiene with rules nobody has written down as a manifesto: every statement carries a status label; bounded evidence never becomes a general claim; imported theorems carry hypotheses and leaks; capped computations are inconclusive; countermodels are retained, never deleted; status surfaces are regenerated from one ledger. Writing that as an `ORM:` manifesto with rulings gives the rules a home outside two repositories' `AGENTS.md` files, and `claim_governance` becomes its reference implementation.

In the other direction, `NLAP: tools/audit_paper_language.py` and the risky-phrase lists in `claim_governance` are prose linters written in Python; `TS:` already runs Vale, and `ORM:` ships Vale styles. Porting the banned-term and risky-phrase lists to Vale vocabularies would let the same rules run on manuscripts, documentation, and the semantic graph with one tool, and keep `claim_governance` for the checks Vale cannot express (status consistency across surfaces, promotion of open claims).

### A5. TLA+ across repositories

PSC's `ProofArchitecture.tla` is a generic typed-DAG dependency-closure specification; `TS:` has three TLA+ modules for graph constraints, validation, and retry; `SG:` specifies its kernel in prose (`docs/deontic-spec-contract.md`, non-operative). The `proof_records` closure validator, the SG `Justification` chain, and the `TS:` graph constraints are all instances of one specification: a finite DAG of typed nodes with per-edge required outcomes and a closure predicate. One shared module would let TLC check FMK-AUDIT-001's corrected contract before it is implemented twice more. Status: engineering proposal; low cost once FMK's contract is final.

## 3. Ranked next contributions

| Rank | Contribution | Repositories | Kind | First file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Tuning substitutions and the residual-class carrier as a directive sequence (N1) | FMK, NLAP | mathematics, executable | `FMK: substitution_dynamics/substitution.mojo` (constructor), then `NLAP: docs/C1_unresolved_wake_to_carrier_obstruction.md` |
| R2 | Generate every ledger from proof records: `tla/Ledger.tla`, the `[claims]` table of `claim_governance.toml`, NLAP's Mojo ledgers, the docs index | FMK, PSC, NLAP | infrastructure | `FMK: tools/` new generator; closes PSC issue #3 and NLAP audit F5 by construction |
| R3 | Harmonic-measure island and a `density` carrier field (N2) | NLAP | ledger, mathematics | `NLAP: docs/C1_theorem_tag_import_ledger.md` |
| R4 | One canonical encoding and one outcome vocabulary across SG, FMK, CC, NLAP (A1 items 1–2) | SG, FMK, CC, NLAP | infrastructure | `FMK: docs/canonical-encoding.md`, `SG: docs/release-provenance.md` |
| R5 | Obstruction extractor and boundary/interior dichotomy on NLAP's Misiurewicz prefix graphs (N3) | NLAP | executable | `NLAP: src/C1_misiurewicz_prefix_graph.mojo`, on the catalogue of `NLAP: src/misiurewicz_catalogue.mojo` |
| R6 | Research-hygiene manifesto in ORM with `claim_governance` as reference implementation; Vale port of the prose rules (A4) | ORM, FMK, NLAP, TS | tooling | `ORM:` new manifesto directory; `FMK: audit/docs/policy-format.md` |
| R7 | Remaining round-one items: Lean lemma for irreducibility of the exterior-square characteristic polynomial (the statement PSC now actually uses); degree-`n` Pisot screen; Hubbard-tree core-entropy census; p-adic module | PSC, FMK | mathematics | `PSC: PscVerif/PscVerif/Spectral.lean`; `PSC: mojo/psc/pisot.mojo` |
| R8 | `claim_id` on every Mojo test and a "proved claims have passing tests" check (A2); typed-graph export of the registries (A3) | PSC, NLAP, CC, TS | tooling | `PSC: mojo/tests/`, `NLAP: spec/regime_correspondences.toml` |

R1 is ranked first because it is the only item that changes what NLAP's residual object *is*, and it consumes a library both programs already vendor. R2 is ranked second because every audit since 2026-09-10 in both repositories has found status drift between hand-maintained surfaces, and FMK now has the record type that makes generation possible.

### 3.1 Delivery, updated as merges land

This subsection exists because of B6. That item sat unbuilt through a whole round for no reason other than a status line reading "not done" and routing it to R7, where it ranked behind three larger items; nothing about it was hard. A ranking without a delivery column reproduces exactly that failure, so the merges are recorded here as they land.

Unlike the tables above, which are the 2026-09-16 snapshot this audit was written from, this one is a running record: each row is rewritten when a merge changes it, and the merge commits date it. Last updated 2026-09-17.

A row says **delivered** only when every part of its ranked definition in section 3 shipped. Where part of an item shipped, the row says **partly delivered** and the last column names what is still owed, because an item marked done is an item nobody looks at again.

| Item | State | Merged as | Still owed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | delivered. Tuning patterns and the star product in FMK; then the continuation twist, after the parity twist of Derrida, Gervois, and Pomeau was found to be the real-line convention only and to fail on the rabbit. Consumed in NLAP as the residual directive carrier | `FMK: 007e40f`, `FMK: 9d6299e`; `NLAP: a1e7e15` | nothing |
| R2 | partly delivered. `proof_records` generates the TLA+ ledger, the per-assumption-set TLC models, the `[[claim]]` entries, and the docs index from one record table; PSC's sixty records now derive every surface from it | `FMK: dc8bee9`, `FMK: 5854797`; `PSC: 1506e67` | NLAP's Mojo ledgers. `src/C1_final_proof_block_ledger.mojo` and the theorem-tag import ledger are still hand-maintained, and `proof_records` is not vendored into NLAP at all |
| R3 | partly delivered. Separated-pair density over exact rationals, and the scaffolded tag `HarmonicMeasureAlmostEveryFibreTrivial` with its leak stated: a null exceptional set is not an empty one, and it contains the infinitely renormalizable parameters R1 carries | `NLAP: 3417a66` | the `density` carrier field. `docs/C1_separated_pair_density.md` still lists attaching a density to each level of a carrier's catalogue prefix as its own next step |
| R4 | partly delivered. `proof_records/vocabularies.py` maps the sprucegoose and crypto-composer evidence classes onto record kinds under the rule that translation preserves or lowers authority, never raises it | `FMK: 2d29f1d` | the far ends. SG emitting release receipts through the table and CC consuming the closure validator are untouched, as that change's own text says; only FMK's side of the canonical encoding is stated |
| B6 | delivered, out of rank order, because R5 could not start without it | `NLAP: 5a2f404` | nothing within its bounds |
| R5 | partly delivered. The extractor runs the overlap route's pipeline on the catalogue's graphs: productivity backwards from the separated pairs, sink components, and the boundary against interior dichotomy, on a declared prefix whose separators carry landing tags. Under the period-three prefix `1/7, 2/7, 4/7` the catalogue of type `(1, 3)` keeps 20 nonproductive pairs and two boundary obstructions | `NLAP: d8dfa45` | the negative control N3 promised. It is not merely unbuilt: the construction N3 described is not admissible and is vacuous, per the correction in N3 above, so a real one needs separators whose co-landing is declared rather than derived from the points being separated |
| R6 | delivered. The Research Hygiene Manifesto in ORM: nine rulings, with `claim_governance` as the reference implementation and a table stating which six rulings it does *not* enforce; four Vale styles porting the prose rulings, as warnings rather than errors, since a flagged sentence is often correct once a declaration is present; and a root `.vale.ini` making the `vale **/*.md` that CONTRIBUTING documents runnable from the repository root, which it was not, because the only configuration lived under `integrations/vale/`. It also fixed that repository's link check, red on `dev` since January | `ORM: 5b45577` | nothing |
| R7 | partly delivered, one of the four ranked parts. The degree-`n` Pisot screen, canonical in `PSC: mojo/psc/pisot_screen.mojo`, behind a literature gate that narrows the claim to an exact fail-closed implementation of Schur–Cohn composed with the bilinear transform and Routh–Hurwitz, and that records one capability bound: `x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 3` is a Pisot polynomial this method refuses. Separately, the p-adic part's **carrier** landed, and its gate's licence list forbids counting that as the part: an M-adic ball certifies that two points differ and never that they agree, so the step it serves is untouched by its existence | `PSC: 31effdb`, from `e398958`, `da2eca4`, `1a254d3`, `426838f`. Carrier, not a delivered part: `FMK: bd68d11`, from `9241cc9`, `41a2fec` | three ranked parts. The Lean lemma for irreducibility of the exterior-square characteristic polynomial and the Hubbard-tree core-entropy census are untouched; the p-adic part has its carrier and none of its mathematics, which stays behind the splicing and tiling-dictionary bridge. The Lean lemma's obstacle is environmental rather than mathematical: no Lean toolchain is available here, so a proof could only be checked by pushing it to CI |
| R8 | not started | | |

Eight corrections were forced by review during this round and are worth keeping visible, since each was a case where a plausible statement was wrong rather than merely imprecise. One of them, R5's, was a correction to this document: a ranked item's own definition can be the thing that is wrong, and a delivery column that only tracked code would have hidden it. The separated-pair density first flattened separator endpoints into one cut set, which counts every arc as its own class; two atoms outside every separator are not separated from each other, so disjoint separators were overcounted. The exact-type catalogue first claimed a uniform index bound that its type reader did not enforce, and the proposed remedy of enforcing it would not have closed the gap either, because catalogueability is strictly stronger than either bound alone. The obstruction extractor's first negative control was tautological, because N3 had specified a separator prefix built from the very addresses it was meant to separate.

R7's Pisot screen supplied three of those eight. Its irreducibility test called every linear polynomial reducible, because every monic linear polynomial has a rational root, and its own test asserted that false value rather than catching it. Its documented Pisot predicate was weaker than the one it implemented: a Salem polynomial satisfies "one root outside the closed disc, real and greater than one" and is nonetheless correctly classified as not Pisot, so the missing clause is that every other root lies *strictly* inside. And its refusal sentinel claimed a root on the unit circle, which holds for only one of the two classical Routh singularities; the witness is the bound above, a Pisot polynomial the screen refuses whose image has no root on the imaginary axis at all, so reading that refusal as circle evidence would have manufactured exactly what these repositories forbid.

Two further defects in the screen came from neither review nor reasoning about the code. A plain Routh array refuses every reciprocal polynomial, so `x^2 - 3x + 1` was rejected although `2.618...` is an ordinary Pisot number; the classical remedy for that then made a Salem polynomial read as Pisot, because a completed array no longer sees roots on the circle. Randomised comparison against an independently written root finder found both, and the second was introduced by the fix for the first. The screen's five defects therefore split three from review, two from differential testing, and none from reading the implementation, which was the strongest evidence this round for R6's differential-testing ruling until the carrier qualified it.

R7's p-adic carrier supplied the last two of the eight, and the first of them bounds that ruling rather than supporting it. `same_coset` formed each coordinate difference in `Int` and lifted afterwards, so the subtraction wrapped: with `M = [3]`, `a = 2^63 - 1` and `b = -2` the true difference is divisible by three and the wrapped one is not, so the carrier reported as *separated* a pair that shares a coset. Separation is the only certificate it issues, which makes that a soundness defect rather than a precision one. Its differential run had never asked, because every coordinate it generated lay in `[-9, 9]`, where the wrap is unreachable; the oracle's Python integers are unbounded and were right throughout. So a differential test is only as strong as its input distribution, and this one's hole sat exactly where the two languages' integer semantics differ. The second defect was `qmat_pow(m, 0)` returning the identity whatever `m` was, so a singular matrix went undetected at level zero and every correctly sized delta read as a member: detection had been a side effect of the elimination rather than a stated precondition.

R7 also skipped two process gates. That is a different failure from a wrong statement, so it is recorded separately: the screen was first pushed as Python only and without the literature stop/go note, both of which `AGENTS.md` requires, because it was written without reading `AGENTS.md` first.

## 4. Non-claims

- N1 and N2 rest on literature statements marked `[L]`; nothing here promotes them, and the residual-class reformulation is a definition, not a theorem.
- The frontier comparison in N1 is an analogy with a stated leak: substitution dynamics describes the dynamical plane of a residual parameter, and parameter-plane shrinking needs a priori bounds.
- Section 2 concerns engineering structure; none of it bears on `OverlapProductivity`, `ResidualClosureNoMissingLinks`, or any conjecture status.
- `coop_substrate` was not read and is not assessed.
