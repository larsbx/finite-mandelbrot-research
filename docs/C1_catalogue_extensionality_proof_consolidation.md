# C1 catalogue extensionality proof consolidation

Status: active proof consolidation.

This file moves the C1 work from scaffolding into theorem assembly. It records the local lemmas already isolated in the repository, proves the catalogue-extensionality theorem from those lemmas, and identifies the remaining frontier statement for the highest-priority conjecture.

## Terminology declaration: catalogue extensionality proof consolidation

Genealogy: This phrase names a proof-assembly step inside the project. Its field ancestors are rational external ray separation, Mandelbrot fibers, wake combinatorics, and finite combinatorial encodings of rational addresses.

Bridge claim: Definition-only project phrase. It does not introduce a new mathematical object. It collects previously stated local obligations into a theorem-shaped proof.

Known leaks: The consolidation proves only what follows from the named local lemmas. It does not prove generic fiber triviality, MLC, or stabilization of every boundary carrier. It also does not replace theorem tags for rational-ray landing or fiber definitions.

Use discipline: Use the phrase only for this assembly layer. Do not use it as evidence that C1 is solved.

## The local theorem

Let `A` and `B` be finite incidence objects admissible for the C1 bridge. Let `ClassicallySeparated(A,B)` mean that their corresponding classical fiber representatives are separated by an allowed rational-ray separator in the classical fiber definition. Let `Separated_k(A,B)` mean that the finite catalogue prefix `k` contains an admissible separator plus accepted opposite-side witnesses for `A` and `B`.

The local theorem is:

```text
ClassicallySeparated(A,B)
  iff exists k. Separated_k(A,B)
```

This theorem is not C1. It is the bridge that makes the finite catalogue relation coextensive with the classical rational-ray separation relation, assuming the local lemmas below.

## Local lemmas used

1. `RationalSeparatorCodingCompleteness`
   - every allowed classical rational-ray separator has a normalized finite separator code;
   - duplicate ray addresses collapse rather than form a separator;
   - generic boundary landing tags are rejected.

2. `LandingTagCompletenessForFiberSeparators`
   - every separator admitted by the classical fiber definition uses one of the accepted theorem-tag families;
   - numerical landing guesses and MLC-only landing assertions are not tags.

3. `FairEnumerationLemma`
   - every normalized finite separator code appears at some finite catalogue prefix;
   - the prefix is bounded by a finite rank/height of the code;
   - fair enumeration does not assert stabilization.

4. `SideAssignmentSoundness`
   - every accepted finite side witness maps to the matching classical side of the separator.

5. `SideWitnessExtraction`
   - if the classical representatives lie on opposite sides of an allowed separator, finite side witnesses can be extracted from the separator data, incidence references, and wake/order evidence.

6. `OppositeSideSeparationSoundness`
   - accepted opposite-side witnesses for the same admissible separator imply classical separation by that separator.

7. `FinitePrefixToExistentialSeparation`
   - if the separator and witnesses appear in prefix `k`, then `exists j. Separated_j(A,B)` holds.

## Proof: finite to classical

Assume `exists k. Separated_k(A,B)`. Choose a witness prefix `k` and a separator record `S` in that prefix.

By definition of `Separated_k`, `S` is admissible, both side witnesses are accepted, they refer to the same separator, and their open-side labels are opposite. `OnSeparator` cases are excluded.

By `SideAssignmentSoundness`, each finite side witness maps to the corresponding classical side relation. By `OppositeSideSeparationSoundness`, opposite accepted sides for the same admissible separator yield classical separation.

Therefore `ClassicallySeparated(A,B)`.

## Proof: classical to finite

Assume `ClassicallySeparated(A,B)`. Then there is an allowed classical rational-ray separator `S_classical` separating the two representatives in the classical fiber definition.

By `RationalSeparatorCodingCompleteness`, `S_classical` has a normalized finite separator code `S_code`. By `LandingTagCompletenessForFiberSeparators`, the landing evidence required by `S_code` is an accepted theorem-tag family, not a generic boundary assertion.

By `SideWitnessExtraction`, the classical opposite-side relation yields finite side witnesses for `A` and `B` relative to `S_code`.

By `FairEnumerationLemma`, `S_code` occurs in some finite catalogue prefix `k`. Therefore prefix `k` contains an admissible separator plus accepted opposite-side witnesses.

By `FinitePrefixToExistentialSeparation`, `exists k. Separated_k(A,B)`.

## Immediate result

Once the local lemmas are discharged, the finite predicate

```text
exists k. Separated_k(A,B)
```

has the same separation content as the classical rational-ray separation relation used to define fibers.

The remaining C1 burden is therefore not catalogue bookkeeping. It is the frontier statement:

```text
PersistentNonSeparation(A,B) forces collapse to boundary equality,
known trivial-fiber family, or contradiction.
```

## What must happen next

The next proof work should target the frontier route, not more naming layers:

1. prove `CarrierProgressDichotomy` from the canonical content order;
2. prove well-founded descent for strict carrier refinements;
3. prove that every persistent wake ambiguity triggers descent, missing-link exposure, or boundary equality refinement;
4. eliminate the residual case where all links are present, no equality is exposed, and no descent occurs.

The last residual case is the current mathematical target.

## Forbidden shortcuts

The following do not prove C1:

- finite bounded search with no separator found;
- shrinking pictures or rendered images;
- metric diameter language imported into rank 2;
- circle, disk, arc, or analytic locus primitives at rank 2;
- generic boundary landing claims without theorem tags;
- terminology invention without genealogy and leaks.
