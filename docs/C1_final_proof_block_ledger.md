# C1 Final Proof Block Ledger

Status: priority-zero proof ledger.

This ledger is the canonical internal checklist for the final C1 proof object. It does not prove C1. It records exactly which theorem blocks must be accepted by the Mojo theorem kernel before `C1FinalProofObject` may be accepted.

## Final acceptance rule

The final proof object is accepted only when every required block below has status `PROVED_OR_IMPORTED_CHECKED`, every import has assumption checks, and no final branch uses `MissingTheoremCatalogueLink`.

```text
accepts_c1_final_proof_object
  iff all required blocks are checked
  and all final guards are checked
  and no missing-link exit is present
```

## Status values

- `PROVED_OR_IMPORTED_CHECKED`: the block is locally proved by accepted finite proof objects or imported through checked theorem tags with assumptions.
- `SCAFFOLDED`: the statement and checker shape exist, but proof obligations remain.
- `OPEN_FRONTIER`: the block is an active mathematical frontier and may have MLC/fiber-triviality strength.
- `RESEARCH_ONLY`: usable for exploration but forbidden in the final proof object.

## Required blocks

| Block | Current status | Final role | Current next action |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `SeparatorCatalogueSoundness` | `SCAFFOLDED` | finite separator certificate implies classical rational-ray separation | convert side/landing checks into proof objects |
| `SeparatorCatalogueCompleteness` | `SCAFFOLDED` | every admitted classical separator is eventually enumerated | prove finite normalization and fair enumeration coverage |
| `FiberDefinitionAdapter` | `SCAFFOLDED` | persistent finite non-separation presents the classical same-fiber relation on the covered domain | state exact classical fiber convention and on-separator routing |
| `ResidualClosureNoMissingLinks` | `OPEN_FRONTIER` | persistent non-separation exits only through finite separation, boundary equality, or established trivial-fiber tag | eliminate missing-link exits |
| `ExitClosureForC1` | `SCAFFOLDED` | every residual exit has a finite closing payload | connect exit certificates to final proof object |
| `BoundaryEqualitySoundness` | `SCAFFOLDED` | accepted boundary equality implies equality in the adapter | reject label-only equality and require finite/analytic payload |
| `TheoremTagImportSoundness` | `SCAFFOLDED` | accepted imported theorem tags carry valid assumptions | enumerate accepted theorem families and assumptions |

## Forbidden final exits

The following are allowed as research diagnostics but forbidden in the final C1 proof object:

- `MissingTheoremCatalogueLink`;
- bounded search with no separator found;
- label-only equality;
- unchecked theorem tag import;
- rank-2 locus primitive;
- renderer or numerical picture evidence.

## Current bottleneck

The priority bottleneck is:

```text
ResidualClosureNoMissingLinks
```

That block must replace every `MissingTheoremCatalogueLink` alternative by one of the accepted final exits:

```text
FiniteSeparationCertificate
BoundaryEqualityCertificate
EstablishedTrivialFiberTag
```

## Next proof move

The next immediate block is:

```text
TheoremTagImportLedger
```

Reason: residual closure cannot eliminate missing links unless the repository knows exactly which classical theorem tags are accepted, what assumptions they require, and which parameter classes remain uncovered.
