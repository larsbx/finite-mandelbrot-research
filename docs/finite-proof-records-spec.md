# Finite proof-record specification

Status: proposed reusable infrastructure contract. This document defines records
for finite computations, imported theorems, bounded experiments, open
dependencies, and dependency closure. It proves no mathematical statement,
accepts no NLAP-JT certificate, and does not discharge C1 or
`ResidualClosureNoMissingLinks`.

The intended future package name is `finite_proof_records`. The first
implementation must compile and execute in CI before any consumer treats it as
authoritative.

## 1. Separation of responsibilities

The package records and validates provenance and dependency structure. It does
not decide whether a domain theorem is true.

The library owns:

- canonical record kinds and lifecycle states;
- stable identifiers and deterministic field ordering;
- dependency edges and closure validation;
- validation of required provenance fields;
- the distinction between invalid, incomplete, bounded, and accepted records;
- consumer-supplied policy decisions represented as explicit results.

Consumers own:

- mathematical predicates and proof rules;
- the list of admissible external theorem families;
- domain-specific forbidden claims;
- certificate acceptance;
- hash-suite selection and commitment construction;
- whether a validated record is sufficient for a theorem or release decision.

In particular, the NLAP-JT restrictions on circle primitives and global
MLC-strength claims remain NLAP-JT policy. PSC's G1, concentration, renewal,
realization, and productivity boundaries remain PSC policy.

## 2. Record kinds

Every record has exactly one kind.

| Kind | Meaning | May close a dependency? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `finite_computation` | Deterministic finite computation with replay metadata | Yes, only for the exact finite proposition named |
| `formal_derivation` | Locally checked rule applications with explicit premises | Yes, within the declared rule system |
| `imported_theorem` | External theorem with source, statement, hypotheses, and a checked use-site match | Yes, only after consumer policy accepts the import |
| `bounded_experiment` | Result over an explicitly enumerated finite domain | No general dependency; only its bounded proposition |
| `open_dependency` | Named proposition not proved or accepted | No |
| `countermodel` | Replayable witness refuting a named statement | Closes only the refuted statement negatively |
| `rejected_record` | Malformed, inconsistent, or policy-rejected input | No |

A bounded experiment must never be relabelled as a formal derivation or
imported theorem merely because its enumerated domain is large.

## 3. Common envelope

Every non-rejected record carries:

- `schema_id`: stable schema name;
- `schema_version`: positive integer;
- `record_id`: canonical identifier derived from the canonical record bytes;
- `kind`: one value from section 2;
- `claim_id`: stable consumer-owned claim identifier;
- `claim_text`: human-readable statement;
- `scope`: exact domain on which the claim is asserted;
- `dependencies`: ordered list of dependency record identifiers;
- `producer`: implementation and version that created the record;
- `payload_encoding`: canonical encoding identifier;
- `evidence`: ordered references needed for replay or source inspection.

Unknown schema versions, unknown record kinds, duplicate dependency
identifiers, noncanonical ordering, missing required fields, and identifier
mismatches reject the record.

Display text, timestamps, filesystem paths, repository URLs, and diagnostic
rendering are not identity-bearing unless a schema explicitly declares them
so.

## 4. Kind-specific payloads

### 4.1 Finite computation

Required fields:

- executable identity and immutable source revision;
- input encoding and exact input digest;
- deterministic configuration;
- completeness boundary;
- resource-cap status;
- output encoding and exact output digest;
- replay result.

A capped, interrupted, skipped, or unavailable execution is incomplete. It is
never a passing computation and never a counterexample.

### 4.2 Formal derivation

Required fields:

- rule-system identifier and version;
- ordered rule applications;
- explicit premise identifiers;
- checked conclusion;
- checker identity and immutable source revision.

The checker must recompute dependency closure. A Boolean supplied by the
producer saying that all rules were checked is not sufficient.

### 4.3 Imported theorem

Required fields:

- source identifier and bibliographic locator;
- theorem statement or stable statement identifier;
- source hypotheses;
- consumer claim being supported;
- use-site domain facts;
- an explicit hypothesis-match result;
- preserved conclusion;
- non-inherited conclusions and leak boundary;
- consumer policy decision.

Source existence, hypothesis matching, and consumer admissibility are distinct
checks. A known source with unmatched hypotheses remains incomplete.

### 4.4 Bounded experiment

Required fields:

- finite domain definition;
- enumeration method;
- completeness statement for that finite domain;
- caps and skipped cases;
- exact summary and retained witnesses.

The record must name both the proposition established on the finite domain and
the stronger propositions it does not establish.

### 4.5 Open dependency

Required fields:

- exact missing proposition;
- downstream claims blocked by it;
- known partial results;
- accepted resolution classes.

An open dependency cannot be converted to accepted by dependency closure.

### 4.6 Countermodel

Required fields:

- exact statement refuted;
- canonical witness;
- replay procedure;
- successful replay result;
- scope showing that the witness satisfies the refuted statement's
  hypotheses.

A witness outside the hypotheses rejects rather than refutes.

## 5. Validation states

Validation returns exactly one state:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `accepted` | Structurally valid, complete for its declared scope, and accepted by consumer policy |
| `bounded` | Valid result whose authority is limited to its declared finite domain |
| `incomplete` | Well-formed but missing evidence, replay, hypothesis match, or dependency |
| `open` | Explicit unresolved dependency |
| `refuted` | Valid countermodel refutes the named statement within scope |
| `rejected` | Malformed, inconsistent, unknown-version, or policy-rejected record |

These states are not Booleans. Consumers must not collapse `bounded`,
`incomplete`, `open`, or `rejected` into false mathematical claims.

Every rejection has a stable reason code. Diagnostic prose is supplementary.

## 6. Dependency closure

Records form a finite directed acyclic graph for one validation invocation.
The validator must:

1. reject missing dependency identifiers;
2. reject cycles;
3. validate every dependency under the same schema and policy context;
4. verify that every dependency's declared conclusion matches its use;
5. propagate `rejected`, `incomplete`, and `open` without converting them
   into negative mathematical evidence;
6. reject an accepted general claim that depends only on a bounded experiment;
7. return the exact set of missing or unacceptable links.

Dependency order is identity-bearing and deterministic. If a consumer treats a
dependency collection as mathematically unordered, it must canonicalize by
record identifier before encoding.

## 7. Consumer policy interface

Domain policy is supplied as data or a typed callback whose result is recorded.
The portable interface distinguishes:

- `allow`;
- `deny(reason_code)`;
- `requires_more_evidence(missing_ids)`;
- `open_frontier(claim_id)`.

Policy must not mutate the record being checked. Policy identity and version
are part of the validation result.

The library ships no default that silently permits imported theorems or turns a
finite computation into certificate acceptance.

## 8. Canonical encoding

The encoding is versioned and domain-separated. Each field is encoded by a
declared scalar or aggregate codec; variable-length values are length-prefixed;
maps are prohibited unless their canonical key order is specified.

Canonical encoding and hashing are separate:

- the package may emit canonical bytes and verify `record_id`;
- consumers select a hash suite and commitment protocol;
- changing a schema, codec, field order, or identity-bearing field changes the
  record identifier;
- a diagnostic renderer is never an encoding oracle.

Rejected and incomplete constructions have no authoritative record encoding.

## 9. Initial implementation boundary

The first Mojo implementation includes:

- record-kind and validation-state closed types;
- common envelope validation;
- dependency DAG validation;
- imported-theorem hypothesis-match records;
- bounded-experiment scope records;
- countermodel records;
- consumer-policy result carriers;
- deterministic encoding test vectors;
- positive, tamper, missing-dependency, cyclic-dependency, capped-computation,
  unmatched-hypothesis, and bounded-to-general negative tests.

It excludes:

- NLAP-JT theorem names and prohibited primitive lists;
- PSC conjecture names;
- cryptographic hash selection;
- certificate acceptance;
- network retrieval;
- trust in producer-supplied aggregate Booleans;
- proof-assistant verification.

## 10. Adoption gate

Extraction into its own repository is allowed only after:

1. the implementation is in the compiled Mojo CI closure;
2. canonical encoding has deterministic golden vectors;
3. dependency cycles and missing links fail closed;
4. bounded evidence cannot satisfy a general claim;
5. imported theorem use requires a checked hypothesis match;
6. NLAP-JT and PSC each supply a distinct policy adapter in consumer code;
7. neither consumer changes any mathematical claim status during migration.

Until then, `src/mojo_theorem_kernel.mojo` remains a scaffold and must not be
described as an authoritative proof checker.
