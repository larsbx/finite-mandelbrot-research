"""The repository's claim-governance policy holds on every surface.

The policy lives in ``claim_governance.toml``; the checker is the vendored
``tools/claim_governance`` package pinned in ``vendored.toml``.  The Mojo
proof-block ledger and its Markdown mirror must agree with the ledger in the
policy, and C1 must remain recorded as an open frontier.
